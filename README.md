# Storytime Reading Tracker
_This application was developed and presented in the final 2 weeks of my time at Tech Elevator's Full-Stack Java Development Bootcamp_

A live version of this application is available [here.](https://storytime-reading-tracker.netlify.app/login)

## Description

   - Storytime is meant for use with families interested in helping foster a love of reading and building good habits. 
   - It was completed as a group of 4 students working with a Scrum Master, who maintained and monitored development pace, and a Product Owner, who outlined necessary features and approved backlog items that met the definition of done.
   - The team practiced agile/scrum principles, developing for user stories in several sprints over the course of the project, and with code reviews afterwards.

## Technology Used

Vue.js, Java, Spring, PostgreSQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
