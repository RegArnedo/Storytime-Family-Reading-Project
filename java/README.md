# Capstone Starter Project

## Database

Setup a database called `final_capstone` using PG Admin. 

Run the database setup script `database_setup.sql` in the PG Admin Query Tool.

Note this will setup 2 users as samples `user` and `admin`. The password for both users is `password`.


### Database users 

>NOTE: This is informational. You do not have to do anything here. 

The database superuser—meaning `postgres`—must only be used for database administration. It must not be used by applications. As such, two database users are created for the capstone application to use as described below:

| Username | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `final_capstone_owner` | This user is the schema owner. It has full access—meaning granted all privileges—to all database objects within the `capstone` schema and also has privileges to create new schema objects. This user can be used to connect to the database from PGAdmin for administrative purposes. |
| `final_capstone_appuser` | The application uses this user to make connections to the database. This user is granted `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` privileges for all database tables and can `SELECT` from all sequences. The application datasource has been configured to connect using this user. |


## Spring Boot

### Datasource

A Datasource has been configured for you in `/src/resources/application.properties`. It connects to the database using the `final_capstone_appuser` database user. You can change the name of this database if you want, but remember to change it here and in the `create.sh` script in the database folder:

```
# datasource connection properties
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/final_capstone
spring.datasource.name=final_capstone
spring.datasource.username=final_capstone_appuser
spring.datasource.password=finalcapstone
```

### JdbcTemplate

If you look in `/src/main/java/com/techelevator/dao`, you'll see `JdbcUserDao`. This is an example of how to get an instance of `JdbcTemplate` in your DAOs. If you declare a field of type `JdbcTemplate` and add it as an argument to the constructor, Spring automatically injects an instance for you:

```java
@Service
public class JdbcUserDao implements UserDao {

    private JdbcTemplate jdbcTemplate;

    public JdbcUserDao(JdbcTemplate jdbcTemplate) {
        this.jdbcTemplate = jdbcTemplate;
    }
}
```

### CORS

Any controller that'll be accessed from a client like the Vue Starter application needs the `@CrossOrigin` annotation. This
tells the browser that you're allowing the client application to access this resource:

```java
@RestController
@CrossOrigin
public class AuthenticationController {
    // ...
}
```

## Security

Most of the functionality related to Security is located in the `/src/main/java/com/techelevator/security` package. You shouldn't have to modify anything here, but feel free to go through the code if you want to see how things work.

### Authentication Controller

There is a single controller in the `com.techelevator.controller` package called `AuthenticationController.java`.

This controller contains the `/login` and `/register` routes and works with the Vue starter as is. If you need to modify the user registration form, start here.

The authentication controller uses the `JdbcUserDao` to read and write data from the users table.


## Testing


### DAO integration tests

`com.techelevator.dao.BaseDaoTests` has been provided for you to use as a base class for any DAO integration test. It initializes a Datasource for testing and manages rollback of database changes between tests.

The following is an example of extending this class for writing your own DAO integration tests:

```
package com.techelevator.dao;

import com.techelevator.model.User;
import org.junit.Assert;
import org.junit.Before;
import org.junit.Test;
import org.springframework.jdbc.core.JdbcTemplate;

import javax.sql.DataSource;

public class JdbcUserDaoTests extends FinalCapstoneDaoTests {

    private JdbcUserDao sut;

    @Before
    public void setup() {
        DataSource dataSource = this.getDataSource();
        JdbcTemplate jdbcTemplate = new JdbcTemplate(dataSource);
        sut = new JdbcUserDao(jdbcTemplate);
    }

    @Test
    public void createNewUser() {
        boolean userCreated = sut.create("TEST_USER","test_password","user");
        Assert.assertTrue(userCreated);
        User user = sut.findByUsername("TEST_USER");
        Assert.assertEquals("TEST_USER", user.getUsername());
    }

}
```
